# Mathematical Foundations of the Happiness U-Shape

This repo is a collection of files containing preliminary analysis aimed at establishing a mathematically-sound framework to describe the allocation of 'happiness' over the lifespan that yields a U-shape; a phenomenon that tends to be seen in empirical evidence.

It currently contains one folder with two files:
- `solving_bellman_equations.py`, which contains generic code to solve certain dynamic programming problems
- `time-dep_problem_analysis.ipynb`, which contains my current modelling of the happiness determination process
